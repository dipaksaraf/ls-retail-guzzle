RetailClient for Lightspeed Retail
==================================

The class is an extension of the Guzzle 6 PHP HTTP Client for use with the Lightspeed Retail API.

It works the same way as the standard Guzzle Client, but takes care of refreshing access tokens and rate limiting.

You can install Guzzle with Composer by running `composer update` in this directory.

For usage examples, see `index.php`.
